/**
 * The {@link SlotElement}s currently attached to an open screen. MenuKit's screen hook
 * uses it to resolve hover and click for slots hosted in panels.
 *
 * <p>The {@code getHoveredSlot} interception goes through {@link CreatedSlotScreenHook},
 * which needs to know which panels currently host a live {@link SlotElement} so it
 * resolves only those. This registry supplies that set, and the hook resolves them
 * through {@link CreatedSlotInput#resolveHoveredSlot}, which handles creative. So a
 * slot in a panel takes clicks and hovers correctly with no extra code.
 *
 * <p>A {@link SlotElement} adds itself in {@code onAttach} (when its panel is matched
 * to an opening screen) and removes itself in {@code onDetach} (when the screen
 * closes). The panel lifecycle keeps those balanced, so only the live screen's
 * SlotElements are ever here and a plain identity set is enough.
 *
 * <p>Client only: attach, detach and hover resolution all run on the render and
 * input thread, and the server never touches it.
