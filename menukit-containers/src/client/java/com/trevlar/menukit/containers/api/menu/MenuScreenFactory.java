/**
 * Builds the client {@link CustomContainerScreen} for a registered {@code CustomMenu}.
 * Its shape matches both {@code MenuScreens.ScreenConstructor.create} and the
 * three-argument {@link CustomContainerScreen} constructor, so the default factory is
 * just {@code CustomContainerScreen::new}, and a consumer subclass (overriding
 * {@code init()} for its own keys, listeners or drag) fits as {@code MySubclass::new}.
 *
 * <p>Client only. It builds a GUI object and is called only from
 * {@code ClientMenu.registerScreens()} on the client (run from
 * {@code MenuKitContainersClient.onInitializeClient}), never on a dedicated server. It
 * lives in Containers' client source set, so common code cannot name it.
