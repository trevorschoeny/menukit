/**
 * Client-side input resolution for registered slots hosted in panels: the hover and
 * click side of {@code SlotElement}, and where a panel makes what it covers inert for
 * slots. Called from {@link CreatedSlotScreenHook}, which passes the active panel ids
 * from {@link SlotElementRegistry}. Not for consumers.
 *
 * <h3>Why it is needed</h3>
 *
 * Registered {@link CreatedSlot}s are appended last to {@code menu.slots}, so where a
 * registered slot sits over a vanilla slot, vanilla's {@code getHoveredSlot} (which
 * returns the first slot under the cursor) would pick the vanilla slot beneath it.
 * The registered slot is visibly on top (its panel drew the frame and vanilla drew
 * the item at the same {@code x/y}), but clicks would go through it. The rule that
 * everything behind a panel is inert never reached it, because that rule works from
 * MenuKit's panel registry, while a registered slot's hover is resolved from the
 * slot, not the panel box. This class resolves it from the slot. Where a registered
 * slot covers no vanilla slot, vanilla would find it by {@code x/y} on its own, and
 * the result here is the same.
 *
 * <h3>What it does</h3>
 *
 * {@link #resolveHoveredSlot} answers, for a screen point:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>over a revealed registered slot: that slot wins, and hover and click go to it
 *       rather than the covered vanilla slot;</li>
 *   <li>inside a revealed registered panel but between slots: blocked, so the covered
 *       vanilla slot is inert across the panel's bounding box;</li>
 *   <li>anywhere else: pass, and vanilla resolves as usual.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Hidden (inert) registered panels neither win nor block.
 *
 * <h3>How it is wired</h3>
 *
 * MenuKit's {@code AbstractContainerScreen} mixins ({@code getHoveredSlot},
 * {@code mouseClicked}) call the {@link com.trevlar.menukit.inject.SlotScreenHook}
 * dispatch, which Containers fills with {@link CreatedSlotScreenHook}. That hook calls
 * {@link #resolveHoveredSlot} with the panel ids that currently host a
 * {@code SlotElement}. The {@code getHoveredSlot} hook makes the registered slot win
 * hover, tooltip and the click target (vanilla sends the click to whatever
 * {@code getHoveredSlot} returns). The {@code mouseClicked} hook makes the panel's
 * empty space inert, so a click in a gap can't fall through and drop a carried item.
 * No consumer mixin is involved.
 *
 * <h3>Client only</h3>
 *
 * References client screen types and only loads on the client. The slot itself
 * ({@link CreatedSlots}) has no client types and runs on both sides.
