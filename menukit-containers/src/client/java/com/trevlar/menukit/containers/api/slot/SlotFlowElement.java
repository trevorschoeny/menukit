/**
 * Lays out a panel's registered slots to fit its width, the way text and elements
 * size to fit. One {@link PanelElement} owns the panel's slots and flows the visible
 * ones into the panel's available content width, wrapping onto new rows below.
 *
 * <h3>Why a flow and not a fixed grid</h3>
 *
 * A {@link ContainerPanel}'s slots used to sit at fixed {@code (childX, childY)}
 * positions on a column count the consumer declared. A panel whose groups reveal
 * separately had to pin a wide fixed width to reserve the largest extent. That left
 * empty space when only a narrow group was shown, and slid the panel sideways (a
 * flicker) when a wider group revealed over a narrow one near the screen edge. This
 * element has no fixed grid and no pinned width: the visible slots flow into whatever
 * width the panel has this frame, and the panel fits around the result.
 *
 * <h3>Stable budget, fitted size</h3>
 *
 * {@link #naturalWidth()} reports the width of all slots in one row, which doesn't
 * depend on which groups are revealed. The panel computes
 * {@code contentWidth = min(naturalWidth, ceiling)}. The natural width is almost
 * always larger than the screen-edge ceiling the placement layer sets, so the budget
 * passed to {@link #layoutWithin} is that ceiling, which depends on screen geometry
 * and not on slot visibility, so it stays the same across reveals. The panel
 * therefore never re-runs its cached configuration pass when a group toggles:
 * {@link #getWidth()}, {@link #getHeight()} and {@link #render} recompute the fitted
 * layout from the current visibility every frame against that budget. The panel
 * reports the fitted width, so it stays narrow and never triggers the screen-edge
 * slide, while the flow knows it may grow up to the budget before wrapping. Reveals
 * need no extra handling, and there is no empty space and no flicker.
 *
 * <h3>Client rendering only</h3>
 *
 * The flow positions are presentation only. Each child {@link SlotElement} resolves
 * its live slot by identity and writes its {@code Slot.x/y} every frame, so the real
 * synced slots' identity and sync are untouched; only where vanilla draws and
 * hit-tests them changes. Its slots stay live under the panel through
 * {@link #presentsSlotAt}. The empty cells of a partial last row belong to the panel
 * and are inert.
