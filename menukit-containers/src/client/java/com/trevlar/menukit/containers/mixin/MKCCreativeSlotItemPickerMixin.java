/**
 * Makes registered slots (pockets, equipment) appear and work on the creative tabs
 * other than the inventory tab: combat, tools, search and the rest.
 *
 * <h3>Why only the inventory tab showed them</h3>
 *
 * The creative menu ({@code ItemPickerMenu}) has a fixed base set of slots, the 5x9
 * item grid and the player hotbar, built once in this constructor. Only on the
 * inventory tab does {@code selectTab} swap that base for wrappers of every
 * {@code player.inventoryMenu} slot (registered ones included, which
 * {@code MKCCreativeSlotParkMixin} parks off-screen). Leaving the inventory tab
 * restores the base. So the slot dispatch, which walks the active {@code menu.slots}
 * and unwraps each with {@code Slots.target}, finds the slot on the inventory tab but
 * never in the base set the other tabs show. That is why creative pockets worked in
 * the inventory but not on the other tabs.
 *
 * <h3>The fix: add the slots to the base set, once</h3>
 *
 * At constructor TAIL this appends one {@link CreativeSlotWrapper} per registered
 * {@code inventoryMenu} slot to the base {@code menu.slots}. Vanilla's own
 * {@code originalSlots} save and restore then handles them: entering the inventory
 * tab, vanilla saves the base (these wrappers included) and rebuilds from
 * {@code inventoryMenu}; leaving it, vanilla restores what it saved. So the slot is
 * represented by vanilla's parked wrapper on the inventory tab and by this one on
 * every other tab, never both at once, and the dispatcher draws exactly one copy at
 * {@code renderX/renderY} throughout.
 *
 * <p>{@code MKCCreativeSlotClickRouteMixin} reroutes placement clicks on these
 * wrappers to the inventory-tab path, since the base set's click path is client-only
 * and would not reach the slot's backing storage.
 *
 * <p>Generic: detects a slot by {@code instanceof CreatedSlot}, with no per-consumer
 * knowledge. Client only, since the creative screen is a client type.
