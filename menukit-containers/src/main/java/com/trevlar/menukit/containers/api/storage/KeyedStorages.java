/**
 * Factories for {@link KeyedStorage}, a {@link Storage} that declares its own
 * {@link PersistentContainerKey} so per-slot state persists for registered slots.
 *
 * <p>The player-scoped factory is the supported way to register player-owned storage
 * (pockets or equipment slots, say) with per-slot state. It wraps a content
 * {@link Storage} (usually bound from a {@link StorageAttachment}) and tags it with a
 * {@link PersistentContainerKey.Modded} key whose payload names the owning player.
 * MenuKit's {@code ContainerIdentity} routes the registered slot to this key, and the
 * server resolves it to a bag on the player keyed by resolver id, so different slots
 * and different mods never collide.
 *
 * <p>The library owns the payload shape. These keys are made by the library, unlike
 * the opaque payloads consumers define for their own modded resolvers. The constants
 * below are the contract between this factory and {@code SlotStateServer}'s
 * {@code Modded} resolution.
