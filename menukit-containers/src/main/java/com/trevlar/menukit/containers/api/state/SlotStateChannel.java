/**
 * A typed per-slot state channel, the handle consumers use to read and write slot
 * state. Created with {@link SlotState#register(Identifier, Codec, StreamCodec, Object)}
 * (PRIVATE) or {@link SlotState#register(Identifier, Codec, StreamCodec, Object, Visibility)}.
 *
 * <p>A channel has two codecs. {@link #codec} is for persistence and encodes to NBT
 * through {@code NbtOps.INSTANCE}, so stored values are readable with vanilla's
 * {@code /data get}. {@link #streamCodec} is the compact binary form sent over the
 * network.
 *
 * <h2>State lives in the open menu; behaviour does not</h2>
 *
 * The {@link Address} methods here ({@link #get(Address)}, {@link #set(Address, Object)}
 * and their explicit-viewer versions) work differently from how slot behaviour is set
 * up, on purpose:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Behaviour (gating, binding, mending, quick-move) is declared by address at
 *       init and applies as soon as a slot with that address appears. It lives in the
 *       engine, independent of any open menu.</li>
 *   <li>State read or written by address resolves against the viewer's currently
 *       open menu. If the address names no live slot in that menu, a read returns
 *       {@link #defaultValue} and a write does nothing. There is no address-based path
 *       for init-time or menu-free state.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>For menu-free state, server automation, or a created slot's state at init time,
 * use the persistent-key overloads instead. They name storage directly, with
 * no open menu and no live slot:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #get(Player, PersistentContainerKey, int)} and
 *       {@link #set(Player, PersistentContainerKey, int, Object)}: player-, block entity-
 *       or entity-scoped state through a {@link PersistentContainerKey} and a
 *       container-slot index (server only).</li>
 *   <li>{@link #get(Container, int)}: a SHARED value at a placed container by index,
 *       with no viewer, for hopper or dropper automation.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>In short, use addresses for behaviour and for state in an open menu, and the
 * persistent keys whenever there is no open menu to resolve against.
