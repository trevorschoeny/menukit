/**
 * Lets a consumer add extra items to the XP repair pool, beyond the registered slots
 * opted in by address through {@code ContainerKeys.MENDING}.
 *
 * <p>A consumer like Inventory Max may want to mend any item in the inventory.
 * Without this hook it would need its own {@code ExperienceOrb} mixin, and the two
 * would compete for the same per-orb repair, spending the XP twice. A {@link Provider}
 * registered here puts those items in the same pool Containers already builds, so one
 * orb still repairs one item.
 *
 * <p>Containers never decides to mend the vanilla inventory on its own; it only
 * mends what a consumer hands it. Which items (gated behind a broad-mending toggle,
 * say) is decided entirely in the consumer's {@link Provider}.
 *
 * <p>Containers applies vanilla's check itself (damaged and carrying the
 * {@code REPAIR_WITH_XP} effect), so a provider may hand over a whole inventory
 * unfiltered. If a candidate is chosen, its {@link Candidate#stack()} is repaired in
 * place with vanilla's math, and then {@link Candidate#onRepaired()} is called. That
 * callback must save and sync the source (write the stack back or mark its storage
 * dirty), since an in-place durability change alone may not reach disk.
