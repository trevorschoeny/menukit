/**
 * Server-side projection hook: appends a player's registered projected slots onto a
 * just-opened foreign menu, before its first content sync.
 *
 * <h3>Why {@code initMenu} HEAD, not {@code openMenu} RETURN</h3>
 *
 * {@code ServerPlayer.openMenu} runs {@code createMenu}, sends OpenScreen, then calls
 * {@code initMenu(menu)}, and {@code initMenu} does the initial
 * {@code sendAllDataToRemote}. Injecting at {@code openMenu} RETURN would append the
 * slots after that content was sent. The first {@code ContainerSetContent} would
 * leave them out, and the client menu (which appends slots at {@code AFTER_INIT})
 * would be one block longer than the packet, which always desyncs
 * {@code remoteSlots}. Injecting at {@code initMenu} HEAD puts the slots on the menu
 * just before that method sends content, so the initial packet already has them. The
 * client's {@code AFTER_INIT} append, also before its content packet, matches this.
 * See {@link CreatedSlotProjection} for the full sync-safety rules.
 *
 * <p>Does nothing for a menu with no registered projection source. The player's own
 * {@code InventoryMenu} gets its slots from {@code MKCInventoryMenuMixin} and is
 * never registered here. Server side only ({@code ServerPlayer}); the matching client
 * hook is in the Containers client initializer.
