/**
 * The library's one generic "open my menu" request from client to server. Carries only
 * the {@link Identifier} of the {@code CustomMenu} the client wants opened. The server
 * receiver, registered once in {@code MenuKitContainers.init()}, looks the menu up by
 * that id, moves to the main thread and calls {@code CustomMenu.open(player)}.
 *
 * <p>Custom menus used to ship their own hand-written open payload each. Now one
 * payload and one receiver serve every {@code CustomMenu} a consumer defines, keyed by
 * the menu's registered id. An unknown id is logged loudly on the receiver side, never
 * an NPE. The server opens the menu only when its definition declares
 * {@code validWhen} and it holds for the player ({@code CustomMenu.handleOpenRequest}).
