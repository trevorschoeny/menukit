/**
 * A slot that is a vanilla {@link Slot} to everything outside it. It keeps its place
 * in the hierarchy (panel, group, index) in final fields and belongs to a
 * {@link SlotGroup}.
 *
 * <p>It behaves like a vanilla slot. Every override calls {@code super}, so
 * vanilla's behaviour and other mods' mixins still apply. It is also presented like
 * one: its position is vanilla's own {@code Slot.x/y}, vanilla's slot pass draws it,
 * and vanilla's {@code getHoveredSlot} finds it (see {@code ContainerScreenLayers} in
 * MenuKit). A third party's {@code extractSlot} mixin, or any code that walks
 * {@code menu.slots} and reads {@code x/y}, treats a created slot and a vanilla slot
 * the same because they go through the same calls. The overrides:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code mayPlace}: false when inert, otherwise super</li>
 *   <li>{@code mayPickup}: false when inert, otherwise super</li>
 *   <li>{@code getItem}: EMPTY when inert, otherwise super</li>
 *   <li>{@code isActive}: false when the panel is hidden, otherwise super</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>A mod that mixes into {@code Slot.mayPlace} to add a global filter sees its
 * filter run on MenuKit slots through the {@code super.mayPlace} call, and the most
 * restrictive answer wins. A mod iterating slots sees inert MenuKit slots as empty,
 * which is a valid state for any slot.
 *
 * <p>Hierarchy: Screen, then Panel, then SlotGroup, then CreatedSlot.
