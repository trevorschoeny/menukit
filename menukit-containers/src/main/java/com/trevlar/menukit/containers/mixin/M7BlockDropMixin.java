/**
 * Drops the contents of {@code blockScoped} storage attachments as item entities
 * when a block entity is removed, before it is destroyed. Consumers using
 * {@code StorageAttachment.blockScoped(...)} get the same drop-on-break behaviour as
 * a vanilla container with no extra work.
 *
 * <p>Targets {@link BlockEntity#preRemoveSideEffects(BlockPos, BlockState)} at
 * HEAD. In 26.2 this is the pre-removal hook where vanilla drops container contents
 * ({@code BaseContainerBlockEntity.preRemoveSideEffects} calls
 * {@code Containers.dropContents}). Dropping at HEAD means attachment contents drop
 * alongside the vanilla block entity's inventory, in the same frame and with the
 * same physics.
 *
 * <p>The injection only reads the attachment. It doesn't cancel or change vanilla's
 * removal, so other mods can inject at the same point. Drops happen on the server
 * only, because {@link BlockScopedDropHandler#dropAllAt(Level, BlockPos, BlockEntity)}
 * checks {@code level.isClientSide()}.
 *
 * <p>Consumers who want their attachment's contents lost instead declare it with
 * {@code StorageAttachment.custom(spec)} rather than {@code blockScoped(...)}. Only
 * blockScoped attachments are in the registry this mixin reads.
