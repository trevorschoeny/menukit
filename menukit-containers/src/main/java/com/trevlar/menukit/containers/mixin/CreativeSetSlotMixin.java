/**
 * Makes registered slots round-trip in creative. Without it, items placed in a
 * registered slot in creative silently vanish, and the consumer has no way to fix
 * that (this first showed up with Inventory Max's equipment slots).
 *
 * <h3>Why the packet handler</h3>
 *
 * Survival slot edits go through {@code ServerboundContainerClickPacket} to
 * {@code menu.clicked}, which reaches a registered {@link CreatedSlot} like any other
 * slot. Creative edits take a different server path,
 * {@code ServerboundSetCreativeModeSlotPacket} to {@code handleSetCreativeModeSlot},
 * which only handles vanilla slot indices: it writes
 * {@code player.inventoryMenu.getSlot(n)} only for {@code n} in {@code [1, 45]},
 * drops {@code n < 0}, and silently discards everything else. A registered slot sits
 * past index 45 (it is appended after the offhand), so its creative placement hits
 * the discard path and the item vanishes on the server. The fix belongs in the
 * packet handler, before survival and creative diverge, not in a per-screen mixin
 * that creative would bypass.
 *
 * <h3>What it does</h3>
 *
 * At HEAD, for a creative player, if the incoming slot index resolves to a registered
 * {@link CreatedSlot} on the inventory menu, it repeats vanilla's own in-bounds write
 * for that index: {@code setByPlayer} (which goes through the slot's
 * {@code StorageContainerAdapter} to the backing {@code Storage}, and skips
 * {@code mayPlace} just as vanilla creative does), then {@code setRemoteSlot} and
 * {@code broadcastChanges} to keep the client in sync. Then it cancels, so vanilla's
 * discard never runs. Every other index (vanilla slot, drop sentinel, out of range)
 * is left to vanilla.
 *
 * <h3>Generic</h3>
 *
 * Registered slots are detected by type ({@code instanceof CreatedSlot}), not through
 * a registry. Every created slot is a {@link CreatedSlot}, so this covers all of them
 * with no per-feature knowledge. Only the library knows a slot is registered, so the
 * library has to own this. It routes the consumer's own slot and decides no consumer
 * behaviour.
