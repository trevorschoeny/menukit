/**
 * Projects {@code InventoryMenu}-bound slots onto foreign menus (chests, furnaces,
 * donkeys, any {@link AbstractContainerMenu}), so a slot a consumer registered for the
 * player inventory also appears, takes clicks and syncs on a container screen. This
 * extends inventory-screen parity from "every screen whose menu already carries the
 * slot" to "every screen that shows the player inventory."
 *
 * <h3>Why the library owns a registry here</h3>
 *
 * {@link CreatedSlots} has no registry on purpose: for the player's own
 * {@code InventoryMenu} the consumer owns the {@code <init>} mixin, so the library
 * injects nothing. Foreign menus have no such per-menu hook a consumer could own.
 * {@code AbstractContainerMenu}'s constructor doesn't carry the player, and mixing
 * into every menu class (modded ones included) isn't generic. To cover them, the
 * library has to own a player-lifecycle hook ({@code ServerPlayer.initMenu} on the
 * server, {@code ScreenEvents.AFTER_INIT} on the client) and so a registry of what to
 * project. It is kept as narrow as possible: a registry of slot factories the library
 * only invokes (data plus a deterministic build function), never a behaviour callback
 * that decides how interaction works. The slots it builds are ordinary
 * {@link CreatedSlot}s, so rendering, clicks into the storage, creative and sync all
 * take the same vanilla-slot paths the {@code InventoryMenu} slot uses. The library
 * adds slots to a foreign menu's list and invents no behaviour.
 *
 * <h3>Sync safety</h3>
 *
 * The slots must appear on the server menu and the client menu in the same set and
 * order, before the menu's first content sync, or {@code remoteSlots} and
 * {@code broadcastChanges} desync (items flicker or duplicate). So both hooks call
 * this one {@link #appendProjectedSlots} against the same registry:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>server: {@code ServerPlayer.initMenu} HEAD, which runs after
 *       {@code createMenu} but before {@code initMenu} sends the initial
 *       {@code ContainerSetContent}, so that packet already includes the slots;</li>
 *   <li>client: {@code ScreenEvents.AFTER_INIT}, which fires synchronously inside
 *       {@code handleOpenScreen} before the content packet is processed, so the
 *       client menu has the slots when it arrives.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Both sides walk the same sources in the same order, and each source's factory
 * builds the same slot (same player-attached {@code Storage} size, same layout), so
 * the appended blocks are byte-identical. Keep the registry order, the reveal
 * predicate and the storage size the same on both sides.
 *
 * <h3>What projection does not do</h3>
 *
 * Projection only puts the slots on the foreign menu. The panel pipeline draws them
 * (each slot is a {@code SlotElement} on its {@code ContainerPanel}, which renders
 * inline on whatever screen its parity matcher accepts). Shift-click into them is the
 * handler's own {@code quickMoveStack}, and creative placement is the creative
 * set-slot bridge, which now works on any menu. A consumer that wants pockets on a
 * chest registers a projection source here and also widens its panel's parity
 * targeting to that screen.
