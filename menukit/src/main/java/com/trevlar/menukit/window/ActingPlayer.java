/**
 * Who is clicking, for the duration of one menu click transaction.
 *
 * <p>Vanilla's deep seams have no player in scope: {@code moveItemStackTo} (the
 * destination side of a shift-click) takes a stack and a slot range and nothing
 * else. A decision made there that depends on the player (a per-player lock, a
 * capability check) needs the player captured at the click boundary. The library
 * captures it in {@code AbstractContainerMenu.clicked} and clears it in a
 * {@code finally}, so it never outlives the click.
 *
 * <p>A mod may also move items on the server with no click at all, calling a
 * menu's {@code quickMoveStack(player, index)} directly (Inventory Max restocking
 * from a pocket). {@code quickMoveStack} is abstract and every menu overrides it,
 * so it cannot be wrapped once; every one of those moves goes through
 * {@code moveItemStackTo}, which is concrete and is the seam that lacks a player.
 * The library wraps it: when no click set the player, the menu's own player is
 * acting ({@link #ownerOf}). Automation (a hopper) never touches a menu, and stays
 * {@code null}.
 *
 * <p>This was Containers' {@code GatingContext} thread-local in 5.0.0. It lives here
 * so MenuKit's operation seams can see the player without Containers installed.
