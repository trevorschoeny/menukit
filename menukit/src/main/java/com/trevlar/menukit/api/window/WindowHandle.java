/**
 * The base of the window's typed handles: an immutable value that addresses one
 * thing by its {@link Address}, never by a live reference. The menu and every
 * {@code Slot} are recreated on each reopen, so a held reference would go stale.
 * {@code equals} and {@code hashCode} are over the address, so two handles naming
 * the same thing are interchangeable and safe as map keys.
 *
 * <h2>Two layers</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Generic</b> (here, for every kind): {@link #set} and {@link #behavior}
 *       reach any behavior, including ones added later, with no new handle code.</li>
 *   <li><b>Named methods</b> (the typed subclasses): {@code SlotHandle.gate(...)},
 *       {@code PanelHandle.opacity(...)}, thin wrappers over the generic layer,
 *       limited per kind so a slot verb on a panel handle does not compile.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The handle never returns the raw backing (no {@code getSlot()}). Reads go
 * through {@link #behavior}, which resolves the cascade and is never null. Writes
 * go to {@link WindowEngine#set}.
 *
 * <p>Sealed to the three kinds that exist; a new kind would add a subclass. A
 * handle is resolved on each call, so one consumer line addresses the same thing
 * across reopens, across sides, and for vanilla and created slots alike.
