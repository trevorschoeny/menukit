/**
 * What kind of addressable thing an {@link Address} names. This is the one place
 * the window tells a slot from an element from a panel.
 *
 * <h2>Role in the engine</h2>
 *
 * The resolver never branches on {@code KindTag}. The tag takes part only in
 * {@link Address} equality (so a panel and a slot at the same coordinate never
 * collide) and in which kinds a {@code BehaviorKey} applies to, checked at the
 * call boundary, never inside resolution. Resolution stays kind-blind while keys
 * stay kind-typed.
 *
 * <h2>Open to new kinds</h2>
 *
 * The engine always has a default branch for this enum, so adding a constant later
 * is source-compatible. {@code Decl}, by contrast, is closed: it gets no new arms.
