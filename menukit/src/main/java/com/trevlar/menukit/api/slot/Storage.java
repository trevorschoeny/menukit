 *
 * <p>When slots are built, each Storage is wrapped in vanilla's {@code Container}
 * interface ({@code StorageContainerAdapter}). Consumers see only Storage.
 *
 * <p>For persistent storage (on a block entity, a player or an item), see
 * {@code StorageAttachment}, whose factories produce Storage views backed by Fabric
 * attachments or data components that save themselves. For session-only storage,
 * see {@code EphemeralStorage}. For virtual observer views, see
