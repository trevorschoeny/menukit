/**
 * What a {@link ReactiveHook} receives when a slot's contents change. Carries the
 * {@link Address} of the slot, a before and after snapshot of its stack, and a
 * {@link ReactCause}. It never carries the raw {@code Slot}: the window works with
 * slots but does not hand them out.
 *
 * <p>The snapshots are copies taken when the event fires, so a hook sees no later
 * change and cannot change the live slot through them. {@code before}/{@code after} are
 * {@link ItemStack#EMPTY} when the slot was/became empty, so an insert reads as
 * {@code before.isEmpty()} and a take as {@code after.isEmpty()} (or shrunk).
