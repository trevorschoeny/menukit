/**
 * Finds where a <b>player-inventory slot</b> is on whatever screen is open. You
 * name player-inventory slot N and get back its rectangle; MenuKit handles the slot
 * loop and creative's {@code SlotWrapper}, so you write no per-screen geometry.
 *
 * <p>Panel anchoring ({@link SlotGroupCategories}, {@link SlotGroupPanelAdapter})
 * places panels against a <em>category</em> of slots by slicing {@code menu.slots}.
 * This answers a different question: where on this screen is the one slot whose
 * player-inventory index is N? It matches by identity ({@code container} and
 * {@code getContainerSlot}), which creative's {@code SlotWrapper} hides, so it
 * goes through {@link Slots#target}: identity from the unwrapped slot, position
 * from the in-menu slot (the wrapper, which has the creative coordinates).
 *
 * <p>{@code containerIndex} is the slot's index in the player {@link Inventory},
 * the value {@code Slot.getContainerSlot()} reports for a raw player slot:
 * {@code 0 to 8} for the hotbar, {@code 9 to 35} for the main inventory, and the
 * player's equipment indices for armour and offhand. Any player-inventory slot
 * works, not just the hotbar.
 *
 * <p>It works on any screen whose menu shows the player inventory: the survival
 * inventory, the creative inventory tab (wrapped slots), and container screens
 * such as chests and furnaces, which build their own player-inventory slots. No
 * per-menu resolver is needed, because the slots themselves know they belong to
 * the player {@link Inventory}.
 *
 * <p>Client only: it reads the screen frame and the creative wrapper.
