     * Creative inventory uses its own {@code ItemPickerMenu} which rebuilds
     * {@code menu.slots} on every tab change. ScreenPanelRegistry re-resolves
     * slot groups every frame, so the resolver goes by the current slot count:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li><b>Any tab but INVENTORY: always 54 slots.</b> 45 creative items at
     *       indices 0-44, the player hotbar at 45-53. The HOTBAR, SEARCH and
     *       category tabs all use this layout; they change which items show, not
     *       the slot count. Only {@code PLAYER_HOTBAR} resolves, because the
     *       hotbar is always visible in creative.</li>
     *   <li><b>INVENTORY tab: any other size.</b> Vanilla's {@code selectTab}
     *       clears the slots, re-adds wrappers around every slot in
     *       {@code player.inventoryMenu} and then appends the
     *       {@code destroyItemSlot} bin. Without other mods that is 46 wrappers
     *       plus 1 bin, 47 slots. A mod adding N slots to {@code InventoryMenu}
     *       (such as Inventory Plus's equipment slots) makes it 46 + N + 1.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Matching one exact INVENTORY-tab count doesn't work: 46 forgets the bin,
     * 47 breaks as soon as a mod adds slots (Inventory Plus adds 2, giving 49).
     * Indices 0-45, the player-inventory categories, stay put because vanilla's
     * rebuild keeps InventoryMenu's slot order. The cost of {@code size != 54} is
     * that a modded creative tab with a slot count other than 54 would be read as
     * the INVENTORY tab. None is known in vanilla or common mods; narrow the check
     * if one appears.
